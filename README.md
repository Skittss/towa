*Requires Android 11.0 or higher.*

## About
Towa aims to bridge the best features of existing Japanese dictionaries by providing convenient creation of the most informative Anki flash cards of any Japanese dictionary available on Android.

<br/>

It takes inspiration from [Wakari-chan](https://github.com/Mononofu/wakari_chan), [Yomi-tan](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan), and [Jotoba](https://github.com/WeDontPanic/Jotoba), and improves on them:

<div align="left">

__[Wakari-chan](https://github.com/Mononofu/wakari_chan)__:  Great pop-up dictionary, but was missing key learning information like pitch accent, examples, audio, and many word definitions.

__[Yomi-tan](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan)__:  Another great pop-up dictionary, but only use on android restricted to Kiwi browser only (via browser extensions).

__[Jotoba](https://github.com/WeDontPanic/Jotoba)__:  Great web-based dictionary & app, but no pop-up support nor Anki integration.
