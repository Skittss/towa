# Towa
とは (Towa) is an offline bilingual (JP/ENG) and monolingual (JP/JP) japanese pop-up dictionary with Anki integration.

## About Towa?
Towa aims to bridge the shortcomings of existing dictionaries for android users. 

It takes inspiration from [Wakari-chan](https://github.com/Mononofu/wakari_chan), [Yomi-tan](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan), and [Jotoba](https://github.com/WeDontPanic/Jotoba), and improves on them:

* __[Wakari-chan](https://github.com/Mononofu/wakari_chan)__:  
Great pop-up dictionary, but was missing key learning information like pitch accent, examples, audio, and many word definitions.
* __[Yomi-tan](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan)__:  
Another great pop-up dictionary, but only accessible on android using web extensions via Kiwi browser. Pop-up dictionary use is subsequently restricted to that browser.
* __[Jotoba](https://github.com/WeDontPanic/Jotoba)__:  
Great web-based dictionary & app, but no pop-up support nor Anki integration.
